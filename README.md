Welcome to the AutoUpdater Project! This repository contains two main components:

1. **AutoUpdater**: A tool for updating software by downloading and installing the latest files from a web server.
2. **AutoUpdatePackageCreator**: A utility for creating update packages, which can then be used by the AutoUpdater.

Both tools are designed to work together to provide a seamless update experience for software applications.
